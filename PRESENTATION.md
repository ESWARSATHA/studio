## Slide 2: Project Vision & Mission

**Our Mission:** To create an educational web application that empowers Indian artisans with the skills and tools needed to succeed in the digital marketplace.

**The Problem:** Many traditional artisans lack the digital literacy, marketing skills, and business knowledge to sell their products effectively online.

**Our Solution:** A safe, simulated e-commerce environment where artisans can learn and practice:
*   Creating compelling product listings.
*   Developing effective marketing strategies.
